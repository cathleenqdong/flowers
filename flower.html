         Red roses have symbolised love throughout history,firmly cementing their status as the romantic flower of choice.
        In Greek mythology, the red rose was created by the goddess of love Aphrodite, and in Roman times, newly married couples
        wore rose crowns and covered their beds in rose petals.

        In the Victorian language of flowers, red roses have one of the least ambiguous meanings - they're a declaration of
        love, romance, devotion, and passion.

        With all this romantic history, red roses simply can't be misinterpreted. If you're looking for flowers to say
        "I love you" and show someone just how much you adore them, you can't go wrong with a bouquet of velvety red roses.
